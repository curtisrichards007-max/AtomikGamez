# Privacy Policy for "ShiretoMordrdorBot" Bot

## Data Collection
The "ShiretoMordrdorBot" Bot collects the following data to function:
- **Discord User ID**: Used to identify you and track your walking progress.
- **Walking Distance**: Submitted by you via commands (e.g., `/addwalk`), stored as a total in miles.

## Data Usage
- This data is used to calculate your progress, update the community map, and display leaderboards within your Discord server.
- No personal identifiable information (beyond Discord user IDs) is collected or stored.

## Data Storage
- Data is stored in a local SQLite database on the hosting server.
- The developer does not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties.

## Data Retention
- Data is kept indefinitely unless the Bot's `/reset` command is used by an authorized user, which clears all progress.
- You can request data removal by contacting the developer, though this may reset your progress.

## Security
- Basic security measures are in place, but no system is fully immune to breaches. The developer will notify users of any data incidents if they occur.

## Changes to Policy
This policy may be updated as needed. Check back for the latest version.
